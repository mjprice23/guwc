## Professor McGonagall's List of Young Witches and Wizards
When Voldemort took over the Ministry of Magic in the summer of 1997, he
destroyed the register of magical babies, so parents have had to
manually sign their kids up for Hogwarts for the first time since
Rowena Ravenclaw created the register hundreds of years ago. Professor
McGonagall can't handle the peck of owls that have overrun the
circular headmistress's office, so we've been enlisted to create a
tool for parents to sign up their children online (McGonagall can go
somewhere less magical than Hogwarts to view the list during the summer).
We need to construct a web app to keep track of each child, the year that
they were born (starting September 1st, of course), and their parents'
houses while they were at Hogwarts.
